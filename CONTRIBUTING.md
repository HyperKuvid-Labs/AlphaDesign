## Getting Started

AlphaDesign is a hybrid AI-driven optimization system for Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic designs. The project combines:

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Actor-critic model with policy and value heads
- **Genetic Algorithm Engine**: Population-based optimization with F1-specific mutations
- **CFD Integration**: Computational fluid dynamics analysis for performance evaluation
- **Constraint Validation**: F1 regulation compliance and structural integrity checking

### Types of Contributions We Welcome

- **Algorithm Improvements**: Enhancements to neural networks, genetic algorithms, or optimization strategies
- **CFD Integration**: Better fluid dynamics solvers and analysis methods
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management, GPU acceleration, parallel processing
- **Documentation**: Code comments, API documentation, tutorials, and examples
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks
- **Bug Fixes**: Issue resolution and stability improvements
- **Feature Development**: New optimization techniques, visualization tools, or analysis capabilities

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Git** for version control
- **Linux/macOS** recommended (Windows with WSL2 supported)
- **CUDA-capable GPU** recommended for neural network training (optional but preferred)

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HyperKuvid-Labs/AlphaDesign.git
   cd AlphaDesign
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv alphadesign-env
   source alphadesign-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: alphadesign-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd RL
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python verify_setup.py
   ```

5. **Configure the system**
   - Review and modify `config.json` for your hardware capabilities
   - Adjust `population_size`, `max_generations`, and `parallel_processes` based on your system
   - Set `neural_network_enabled: false` if running on CPU-only systems

## Code Style

### Python Standards

- **PEP 8** compliance with 88-character line limit
- **Type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings** in Google style for all public functions and classes
- **Black** for code formatting: `black RL/ --line-length=88`

### Code Organization

```python
"""Module docstring describing the purpose and functionality."""

import standard_library
import third_party_packages
import local_modules

class ExampleClass:
    """Class docstring with brief description.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter.
        param2: Description of parameter.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, param1: int, param2: float) -> None:
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def process_data(self, data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """Process input data with specific algorithm.
        
        Args:
            data: Input data array to process.
            
        Returns:
            Processed data array.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If data shape is invalid.
        """
        # Implementation details
        pass
```
